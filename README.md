# generals-wiki
The various scripts I write to make constructing my generals-notes-wiki easier


These scripts will likely all be python tools meant to automate things I find annoying or repetitive in my work.
For example, I like python to automatically format my initialized wikipedia pages before I use the content.

We'll see what else crops up here, but for now this is strictly formatting games for use with dokuwiki
